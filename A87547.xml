            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Subject</hi> which I treat of, is the Beſt of Hearts; a <hi>Contrite</hi> &amp; an <hi>Humble</hi> One. A <hi>Heart</hi> which is the Price of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. An ineſtimable Jewel, which deſerves our ſelling all we have to purchaſe it. What diſadvantages it may have ſufferd in my hand, who have prepar'd &amp; fash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion'd it according to my
<pb facs="tcp:151194:3"/>Fancy, I pretend not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. As rough, &amp; as unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht as it is, the Jewel is entire: the interiour Value of it is the ſame within it ſelf: And that's aboundantly ſufficient to attone for all. Beſides, <hi>Contrition</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> affect not the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a Modish Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide: Plain Sincerity becomes them infinitely more. An humble Penitent who has an angry God to pleaſe, &amp; trembles under his Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Hand, has ſomething elſe to think of. When a <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> once comes with penitentiall Tears to bathe her Saviour's feet, she quite forgets her Looking-glaſs;
<pb facs="tcp:151194:3"/>&amp; comes, without conſulting it. She brings her precious Ointments with her: But theſe are only for her Lord: They are not, either to <hi>adorn</hi> her ſelf, or <hi>pleaſe</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Method</hi> I have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowd, may perhaps ſeem ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, &amp; require a line or two, to juſtifie it. I begin with the <hi>Love of God. 1.</hi> Becauſe it is the <hi>Firſt,</hi> the <hi>Greateſt,</hi> &amp; indeed the <hi>Whole</hi> Duty of Man. <hi>2.</hi> Becauſe although the <hi>Practiſe</hi> of Repentance commonly begins with Fear, goes on with Hope, &amp; ends in Love; yet where
<pb facs="tcp:151194:4"/>our Practiſe ends, our <hi>Theory</hi> begins; and what is <hi>laſt</hi> perform'd, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally <hi>firſt</hi> deſign'd, and principally aim'd at. <hi>3.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no ground for either Hope or Fear, before we Know our Duty. When we know it, and conſider well how little we obſerve it; Then it is that we begin to tremble at the thought of our Appearance at the Bar: The Terrour of a <hi>Living God</hi> awakens us, and makes us ſenſible, how <hi>fearfull</hi> a thing <hi>it is,
<note place="margin">Hebr. <hi>10.31.</hi>
                  </note> to fall in to his hands.</hi> For this reaſon, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place I shew the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Motives of</hi> our
<pb facs="tcp:151194:4"/>
               <hi>Fear:</hi> Which, to prevent Deſpair, I counterballance with the <hi>Motives of</hi> our <hi>Hope:</hi> And, after all, becauſe Preſumption is the greater danger of the two, (our Pride in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining us to think Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance eaſy, &amp; our Self-Love dayly tempting to Differr it,) therefore I have taken care to shew the <hi>Danger of Delay.</hi> Theſe <hi>Preparations</hi> I thought proper for a <hi>Contrite</hi> &amp; an <hi>Humble Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I deſcribe <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,</hi> I enlarge much more upon the <hi>Reſolutions</hi> of Amendment, than the <hi>Sorrow</hi> due to Sin: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:151194:5"/>theſe Reſolutions are commonly the more neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected of the two. A little Melancholy, or a little Tenderneſs of nature, with no more than meerly Self-Love in the Caſe, may oftentimes produce a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble concern, and even Tears, when we reflect upon the danger we are in: Though all this while, our Darling Humours, our beloved Sins, are every jot as dear to us as ever. Some ſlight <hi>Thoughts</hi> we have, in <hi>generall,</hi> of doing ſo no more: But theſe are only ſuperficiall: They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce not a ſincere &amp; hearty <hi>Deteſtation</hi> of our Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes:
<pb facs="tcp:151194:5"/>They are to God, what our Compliments are to our Neighbours; Theſe are <hi>Words of courſe,</hi> &amp; Thoſe are <hi>Thoughts of courſe;</hi> Both ſignifie juſt nothing.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Sections of <hi>Contrition</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">91.</note> have been printed apart, by One who <hi>ſign'd</hi> the Paper as his Act &amp; Deed; inviting others to <hi>take pen in hand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Intro. Par. <hi>1.</hi> ch. <hi>21.</hi>
               </note> &amp; do the ſame. I ſign it not with my Hand; but only wish, my Reader &amp; my ſelf may ſign it with our Hearts.</p>
            <p>In the firſt four Sections of <hi>Humility</hi> I offer little or nothing of my own. It would not have become me
<pb facs="tcp:151194:6"/>to pretend to much acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with ſo rare a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. And beſides, in ſuch a Matter, ſo extremely diſagreable to our Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nature, there was need of more Authority than mine.</p>
            <p>I conclude with the <hi>Character of a Good Chriſtian.</hi> Having deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd his <hi>Heart,</hi> I thought it would not be amiſs to finish the remainder of his <hi>Character.</hi> In this alſo, I advance not a word of my own. Should I preſume to draw a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to the life, 'twould be in me as great a Vanity as if my Reader should pretend to
<pb facs="tcp:151194:6"/>ſit for the Picture. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the <hi>Scripture</hi> chiefly, &amp; the <hi>Fathers;</hi> now and then a Modern Author: Any helping Hand was welcome in ſo difficult a Piece.</p>
            <p>No matter Who I am. I am a Son of the Church; &amp; Submitt my ſelf entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Her.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have yet ſomething more to ſay, which I had almoſt quite forgotten. It relates not, either to the generall Deſign of this little Tract, or to any conſiderable Part of it; but only to ſome few pages in the laſt Section of Humility Having there propoſed one generall Motive of that Virtue, by ſetting forth the great Enormity of <hi>Sin,</hi> I proceed to ſeverall aggravating Circumſtances of it, and amongſt many others I undertake to prove, that there never was, nor ever can be, upon Earth, any Impiety, Diſloyalty, or Treachery, equall to that of a <hi>Sinner.</hi> This could not be perform'd, without anſwering the Objections of ſome people who ſeem to be of another Mind: And my preſent Buſineſs is only to put my Reader in a way of obſerving, who it is that ſpeaks; that he may not confound my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
<pb facs="tcp:151194:7"/>words with mine. I have heard of a Man who opening the first Volume of S. Thomas of Aquine, &amp; lighting by chance upon the third article, <hi>Utrum Deus ſit?</hi> He no ſooner caſt his eye upon the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>Videtur quod non,</hi> but immediately he shutt it again, &amp; laid it by, as a book perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious &amp; not fit to be read. Tis a groſſe miſtake, to imagine that every thing, which is ſaid <hi>in</hi> an Author, is ſaid by him. In Scripture it ſelf, there is many a thing ſaid, which the Scripture dos not ſay. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: Tis ſaid in Scripture, that <hi>There is no God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. <hi>14.</hi> v. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> and yet the Scripture dos not ſay ſo: tis <hi>the Fool</hi> that <hi>ſays ſo, in his Heart:</hi> And this is my Caſe, in the three Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles above mention'd. There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall things ſaid in them, which I do not ſay. There are Things, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to ſome Tranſactions, which I
<pb facs="tcp:151194:8"/>had no inclination to ſpeak of; but, being Objected by Others, I could not avoid Anſwering. As to the Matter of the Objections, I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing my ſelf; but only Argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Thoſe who are inclin'd to ſay too much.</p>
            <p>Tis commonly ſaid, that <hi>Loſers have leave to talk;</hi> Nor is it altogether without reaſon: VVhy should they not have it? They pay for what they have. But nevertheleſs, how hard ſoever it may be to gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern a man's Paſſion in ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, 'tis certainly a very poor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, when there is nothing but the Temptation to attone for the Sin. Let a Man loſe what he will, a judicious Stander by never likes Him the worſe for being VViſe enough to hold his Tongue: And when we have made the beſt we can of the matter, tis but an unbecoming thing, to be ſo much tranſported as ſome are. A
<pb facs="tcp:151194:8"/>Man's Reputation, in this point, is as much at ſtake as his Money; and, of the two, 'tis better to ſave one, than loſe both.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon ſuch Thoughts as theſe, I have ever been reſerv'd &amp; moderate in ſpeaking of the Times. I hold my Tongue, as an Honeſt man <hi>may,</hi> &amp; a VViſe man <hi>ought:</hi> I ſubmitt to Providence, as many a better Man dos: And, whatever my Thoughts may be, I keep them to my ſelf.</p>
            <p>For this Reaſon alſo (although it be no affront to the <hi>Creation,</hi> to ſpeak ill of the <hi>Chaos</hi> which preceded it) I have, even in thoſe Affairs which were forerunners of the
<note n="*" place="margin">92.</note> preſent Settlement, taken care to ſay nothing of my own. The <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion</hi> is totally Theirs whom I diſpute with: The <hi>Application</hi> only, is Mine. I pretend to ſilence them by their own Principles; &amp; therefore am oblig'd to give them
<pb facs="tcp:151194:9"/>fair Play. I pretend not, to argue from my own Ideas of things, but from theirs; &amp; should be very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous, if I did not repreſent them their own way, according to their own liking. All this while, I know well enough what to think of theſe matters; but is it not my buſineſs, at preſent, to tell any man my Thoughts. VVhatſoever any man may deſerve, I accuſe no man. I endeavour to entertain my ſelf with ſuch Conſiderations as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Contrite</hi> &amp; an <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heart:</hi> I accuſe my ſelf in the Sight of God: And, as for Thoſe who ſo violently accuſe their Neighbours in the Sight of Men, I have ſo much Zeal as to wish They would pleaſe to call home their Thoughts, &amp; find them better Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. Mean time, there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Grace of God can calm the Spirits of Men: And
<pb facs="tcp:151194:9"/>One might as well pretend to chide the VVinds and the VVaves in a Storm, as adviſe people in ſome occaſions to be Silent. The only way of Dealing with ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is to let them run on quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, till the Humour begins to be out of breath. They take it kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they are not contradicted; &amp; are afterwards more willing to hear Reaſon. Let them alone: Let them ſay what they pleaſe of the <hi>Mote</hi> in their Brother's eye: Never interrupt them: VVhen they have done, Then is the Time, &amp; even then 'tis hard enough, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Offence, to mind them of a <hi>Beam</hi> in their own. According to this Method, I have in the <hi>Alluſion</hi> given the Loſers leave to talk: And afterwards, in the <hi>Application,</hi> I make a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, which plainly shews, Their Crimes are greater, in the Sight
<pb facs="tcp:151194:10"/>of God, than ever any Man's were, in the Sight of Men.</p>
            <p>VVhen our Saviour heard the Clamours of the People againſt the VVoman whom they loudly accus'd of Adultery, He knew well enough what to think of the matter, but however He kept his Thoughts to himſelf. He ſaw how violent they were; their ſtones ready in their hands; &amp; themſelves in great haſt to execute the ſentence of her Death. All the while, the Scripture ſays, He ſeem'd <hi>as if he heard them not.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jo. <hi>8.</hi> v. <hi>6.</hi>
               </note> He contradicted nothing; question'd nothing; whatſoever they objected, He gave all for granted. In the end, when <hi>they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued asking him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. <hi>7.</hi>
               </note> &amp; would not be quiet without an Answer, <hi>He ſaid; He that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin amongſt you, Let him</hi> firſt <hi>caſt a ſtone at her.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:151194:10"/>
            <p>And now, pray give me leave to ask: Had the VVoman any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to take it ill of our Saviour, becauſe he ſaid nothing in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? Or had the People any juſt cauſe to be offended at him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he minded them of their Duty? VVithout doubt She was pery well pleas'd to hear him ſay nothing againſt her: And, as for the People, they were confounded by their own principles, &amp; went away quietly, one by one, as ſoon as our Saviour had putt them in mind of being greater Sinners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In a word, Both Parties were pleas'd: The Deſign of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument was a Charity to the One: And his VVay of Arguing was no Injury to the Other.</p>
            <p>If I have not the ſame good Fortune, in pleaſing both Parties, 'tis none of my fault. My VVay of Arguing and the Deſign of my
<pb facs="tcp:151194:11"/>Argument are Both exactly the Same. VVhatſoever my Succeſs may be, My Comfort is, I have done what I can to draw <hi>Good</hi> out of <hi>Evill;</hi> and He who ſees my Heart, I hope, will reward my Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. My Matter led me to it, whether I would or no, And 'twould have been an uncharitable thing, to ſtep out of the way, when I thought my ſelf in ſuch a fair one, of Doing Good.</p>

               <p>TO make it plainly appear that the Love of God above all things is the <hi>Greatest Duty</hi> of a Chriſtian, One would think it were enough to shew, that 'tis a Duty which compriſes all our other Duties; that it is the Total Sum of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; &amp; that, without the leaſt hyperbole, it is the <hi>VVhole Duty of Man;</hi> becauſe all other Precepts whatſoever only are ſo many Branches of this <hi>Great Commandement,</hi> which is the Root of all the reſt.
<note place="margin">Serm. de Orat. Domin.</note> S. Cyprian calls it the <hi>Grand Epitome</hi> of all our Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

               <p>This is enough to give us a confus'd Idea of our <hi>Duty</hi> at a diſtance. If we draw the proſpect nigher, we shall find an infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of preſſing motives which enforce our Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151194:13"/>thoſe Charms which challenge our Affection: Nothing in our God but what is infinitely amiable, &amp; deſerving infinitely more than <hi>All</hi> the Love that we are able to return. Since therefore All and every one of his innumerable Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies are unlimited &amp; boundleſs; ſince they All &amp; every one deſerve a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Eſteem; ſince they command our Love as much as they deſerve it: hence it follows clearly, that our Duty is as boundleſs as their Merit; &amp; that, as S.

               <p>He <hi>always</hi> Lov'd us; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought of us; not only all of us in generall, but every one of us; &amp; Lov'd us with a Love E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall as Himſelf. He ſays, in the Prophet Jeremy;
<note place="margin">13.3.</note> 
                  <hi>I have Lov'd Thee, with an Eternall Love; therefore with loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs have I drawn Thee.</hi> And what more powerfull At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive can there be to <hi>draw</hi> us to Him; than that <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Kindneſs</hi> which from all Eternity took care of our Concerns, contriv'd our future Happyneſs, &amp; drew
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:151194:16"/>a Scheme of all the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means to bring us to it. Except himſelf, He hardly thought of any thing but Us; Our firſt Creation, our Redemption, our Salvation, were always in his Eye; they were the Eternall En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of his mind; they were the Great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign which gave occaſion to the firſt Production of this World, which we ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preferr before Him, though He made it for us. <hi>Never forſake your Old Friend,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccli.</hi> 9.14.</note> your New one will never be like Him.</hi> Alas! who can help it, if we will be ſo <hi>ungratefull,</hi> &amp; forſake ſo ancient a Friend? we may be ſure it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to find a New one comparable to him.</p>
               <p>He Lov'd us, even <hi>when
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151194:16"/>we were his Enemies.</hi> Tis true; The firſt Production of the Univerſe was Proof enough; &amp; no man can deny but that ſo Great a Gift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowd upon us, for our Uſe, aboundantly ſets forth the Greatneſs of his Love. But yet the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the conſtant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of it for our ſakes, who have ſo <hi>long</hi> ſo <hi>much</hi> abus'd it. If the firſt beſtowing of a more than ordinary favour, without any previous merit on our ſide, be ſuch an argument of more than ordinary Love; What is the conſtant repetition &amp; continuation of the Same ſo long a time, although the longer we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it, we demerit more &amp;

S.

<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.15.</note> the leſſe I am lov'd.</hi> We read it in the 12. chapter, which relates his Rapture into the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and without all doubt this <hi>Love</hi> of his was copyed there from the divine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall. If one ſmall Spark of this celeſtial Love had ſuch a wonderfull effect in the Apoſtle's breaſt; What can we ſay or think of that immenſe &amp; boundleſs Fire
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:151194:17"/>of Everlaſting Love, which no Ingratitude of Man was ever able to extinguish! Though our God foreſaw how much it was in vain to court our Love, although He was not ignorant that his Affection for ſo baſe &amp; ſo unworthy Creatures would be more deſpis'd the more he labour'd to endear us to him; though He knew before hand the unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelld Ingratitude of Man; Nevertheleſs He ſent his only Son to ſave us, He could not hold his Hand, He could not deny himſelf the Satisfaction of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Kind. <hi>Be aſtonisht,

What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the interiour value of a Benefit amounts to, when we caſt it up, the Obligation is not taxt by any other weight or meaſure than his <hi>Love</hi> to whom we ſtand indebted for it.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngratefull.</hi> Rather than a Man should think They are ſo, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a thouſand frivolous pretences to diſown the Obligation; they quarrell with the Benefit; revile the Benefactor; &amp; that they may deny a <hi>leſs</hi> Ingratitude they hide it with a <hi>greater.</hi> So asham'd they are to own this fault, that they had rather <hi>be</hi> a thouſand times ungratefull than be once <hi>eſteemd</hi> ſo.</p>

               <p>Three things there are, which gain our Hearts, command our Inclinations, &amp; in a manner gouvern all our Actions; and theſe three things are, <hi>Honour, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, Pleaſure.</hi> Whatſoever we call <hi>Good</hi> falls under one of theſe three Heads; tis ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Honourable, Profitable,</hi> or <hi>Delightfull.</hi> All theſe three ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the <hi>Love</hi> of God;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:151194:23"/>&amp; none of them are ever be found without it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To begin with <hi>Honour:</hi> I take for granted, No man ought to judge that <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That</hi> is <hi>Honourable,</hi> becauſe the Generality of Mankind, by miſtake, is apt to value &amp; admire it; but before he gives his verdict, every man should firſt conſider well the merits of the cauſe. A Wife Man though he liv'd amongſt a Multitude of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidells, &amp; ſaw how much they honour &amp; adore falſe Gods, he would not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſently conclude ſuch Idols <hi>Honourable;</hi> but would rather laugh at thoſe who are ſo blind as not to ſee how litle <hi>They</hi> deſerve it. The Queſtion is not, what we (by a vulgar er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour)
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:151194:23"/>are inclin'd to <hi>honour</hi> moſt, but What it is that is moſt worthy of it? And This upon a ſtrict enquiry will appear to be the <hi>Love of God. Honour,</hi> at all hands, is agreed to be, a <hi>Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> of ſome Excellence; and Nothing can be truly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, if it be not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Excellent.</hi> A man has no juſt Title to his Honour (any more than what the common Duties of Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty amount to) if he have not ſomething in him more than ordinary, ſome Perfection to diſtinguiſh Him, &amp; raiſe him to a Height more elevated than the loweſt Rank of men.</p>
               <p>The Qualities which juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly challenge men's <hi>Eſteem,</hi> are <hi>VViſdom, Justice, Power,</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:151194:24"/>&amp; Whatſoever raiſes us to the Perfection of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<note place="margin">2.2. <hi>q.</hi> 47. <hi>a.</hi> 13.</note> As for <hi>VViſdom;</hi> S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas of Aquine has demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that No man can be truly <hi>VViſe,</hi> who dos not Love God above all things. <hi>He may be,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a VViſe Merchant, or a VViſe Pilot,</hi> a Wiſe Stateſman, or a Wiſe. Generall; becauſe he may be <hi>Prudent in the choice of Proper Means well fitted to the</hi> Purpoſe &amp; <hi>Deſign</hi> of ſuch Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: But 'tis impoſſible to be a <hi>VViſe Man</hi> without being <hi>VViſe in order to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per End of</hi> MAN, the great Deſign of his Creation, which is nothing but the Knowledg &amp; the <hi>Love of God.</hi> A Magiſtrate, who is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted meerly for the <hi>Publick Peace,</hi> whatever he may be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:151194:24"/>in other things, if he be not <hi>VViſe</hi> in order to <hi>that End,</hi> He is not a <hi>VViſe Magiſtrate:</hi> And ſince All Mankind was created to be happy in an Everlaſting Union with God, Whatever a Perſon may be in other Affairs, if he be not Wiſe in order to this End, He may be a Wiſe <hi>VVhat you pleaſe,</hi> but he is not a <hi>VViſe</hi> MAN.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Juſtice,</hi> I would gladly know how any Man is thoroughly &amp; truly <hi>Juſt,</hi> who is perpetually Guilty of the moſt notorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, we can think of. Such is the Man, whoêre he be, that dos not <hi>Love</hi> his Maker as he ought. Tis true; He only is <hi>injuſt</hi> to <hi>God;</hi> He only wrongs Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; he never wrong'd his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:151194:25"/>Neighbour, may be, all his Life. But what would you ſay of a Steward who <hi>only</hi> cheats his <hi>Maſter?</hi> Would you think him a <hi>Just Man,</hi> becauſe he never cheats his Fellow-Servants?</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Power:</hi> I Confeſs it may be <hi>Great,</hi> in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reſpects, but never can be <hi>Abſolute,</hi> without the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> I may ſay the ſame of <hi>Power,</hi> that S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas ſays of Wiſdom. A Man without this <hi>Love</hi> may be a <hi>Powerfull Prince,</hi> a <hi>Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full VVarriour,</hi> or the like: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, without it, He may have all <hi>Power</hi> neceſſary for the main Deſign of <hi>Gouvern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or <hi>VVar,</hi> &amp;c. But ſince, without this <hi>Love,</hi> he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can <hi>Command</hi> his <hi>Paſsions,</hi> nor <hi>Himſelf;</hi> 'tis evident He
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:151194:25"/>has not all the <hi>Power</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to attain the proper <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Man's</hi> Creation: in a word, He is no <hi>Powerfull</hi> MAN, who is not <hi>Maſter</hi> of <hi>Himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you may plainly ſee how theſe three Characters of <hi>VViſe, Juſt, Powerfull,</hi> which are the moſt eſteem'd &amp; <hi>Honour'd</hi> in the World, are only Shadows, &amp; imperfect Semblances, if ſeparated from the <hi>Love of God.</hi> You plainly ſee; that it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the Greateſt <hi>Excellence</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> moſt <hi>Honourable,</hi> moſt <hi>Deſerving</hi> our, <hi>Eſteem;</hi> but that, without it, there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any Thing which <hi>truly is</hi> ſo.</p>

               <p>A <hi>Spirit,</hi> having no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with <hi>Place</hi> (if we beleeve Philoſophers) is neither <hi>here,</hi> nor <hi>there,</hi> nor <hi>any where,</hi> of its <hi>ſelf;</hi> but only by its <hi>Operation</hi> in a <hi>Body,</hi> which is in ſome <hi>Place.</hi> When Angels formerly appear'd with airy bodies, they were truly &amp; ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially preſent in thoſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Forms, which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, by operating there.

               <p>So far you ſee the Parallell betwixt the Preſence of an Angel dwelling in an airy Body, &amp; the Preſence of the Holy Ghoſt inhabiting in us. Only this difference there is. Philoſophers are puzzled to explain the <hi>Virtue</hi> &amp; the <hi>Operation</hi> by which an Angel moves the Body it aſſumes; But Chriſtians, by the light of Faith, have this Advantage over them: They plainly read &amp; underſtand in Scripture, that the <hi>Virtue</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, by which He moves &amp; gouverns us, is <hi>Charity;</hi> &amp; that the <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which <hi>with us</hi> He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces <hi>in us,</hi> is the <hi>Love of God</hi> above all things. <hi>God</hi> the Holy Ghoſt <hi>is Charity:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.8.</note> He is the Conſubſtantiall <hi>Love</hi> of God the Father &amp; the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:151194:36"/>Son. If <hi>Charity</hi> inſpire us; if the <hi>Love of God</hi> direct us, gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern us, &amp; influence the principall Deſigns &amp; Actions of our Life; we then may reaſonably hope,

               <p>That <hi>Inclination</hi> which is predominant, &amp; gouverns all the reſt, is uſually call'd the <hi>Spirit</hi> of a man.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:151194:56"/>recommended them to the admiring World, whoſe eyes were dazled with the glory of their Greatneſs: They were follow'd, waited on, &amp; celebrated in their Generation: But <hi>now,</hi> alas!

There
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:151194:56"/>was a <hi>Time,</hi> when all the ſinfull <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of the World attended them; when they deny'd their Paſſions no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that they askt; when they had full Command of All that they deſir'd, &amp; rather cloy'd than ſatisfy'd their brutall appetites: But now, <hi>No more.</hi> Their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Riches, Pleaſures, All are at an End: Their <hi>Time</hi> is at an End: Their <hi>Time shall be</hi> NO MORE.</p>

               <p>I muſt confeſs The greateſt part of Mankind being ſo inſenſible, ſo ſtupid, ſo immerſt in wordly cares &amp; pleaſures, is enough to juſtifie the pious zeal of thoſe who frequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the menaces of an

But, when they are awake, &amp; looking round about them, take a proſpect of their miſerable State; when every horrid Crime appears in its own dreadfull shape; when Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of paſt offenſes croud into their minds, and overwhelm their heavy thoughts with a deſpairing expectation of no leſſe than everlaſting Miſery: Alas! poor Souls, it is not now a ſeaſonable time to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the motives of their Fear. If ever Comfort &amp; Encouragement were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to allay the pains &amp;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:151194:70"/>anguishes of a deſpairing Soul; Now is the time. What shall we ſay? Tell them, they need not fear? Oh no: The malice of their grievous ſins is infinite; The danger of their lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table State is greater than they can imagine: Let but their Hope be equall to their Fear, they cannot fear too much. How then shall we encourage their expiring Hope? I'l tell you how.</p>
               <p>If God were only <hi>Juſt,</hi> &amp; were not alſo <hi>Powerfull</hi> and <hi>Mercifull,</hi> a Sinner then might lawfully deſpair: But when God's <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> both concurr to comfort the deſponding Heart of an afflicted Penitent, What can he wish for more?

The firſt is; that he <hi>can</hi> relieve us, if he will: the ſecond; that he <hi>will</hi> relieve us, if we pleaſe. <hi>VVill,</hi> without Power, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies but little: Power, without Will, ſignifies much leſs: But when they <hi>both</hi> meet in the perſon of a <hi>Friend,</hi> to whom we always have a free acceſs; who certainly <hi>can</hi> help us, if he will; &amp; no leſs certainly <hi>will</hi> help us, if we pleaſe: Then, let our <hi>preſent</hi> miſery be never ſo great, let the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching danger of our <hi>future</hi> ruine every day ſeem

               <p>If when a Sinner ſtrugles with his Chains; endeavours to break looſe; and more he ſtrugles, more he finds himſelf engag'd; (which the All-ſeeing Wiſdom fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently permitts, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a proud Soul:) If then theſe two great Truths were ſettled in his Mind, to wit, that God <hi>can</hi> free him, if He will; &amp; that He <hi>will</hi> not fail to free him, if he pleaſe; O! with what pleaſure would he relish

               <p>ALthough God's <hi>Power</hi> be the firſt Foundation of our Hope; his <hi>Mercy,</hi> always ready to aſſiſt us, is the principall, if not the only, <hi>Motive</hi> of it.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:151194:81"/>that God is infinitely Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull. But yet the Word of God aſſures us, &amp; it is a fundamentall Truth which every Chriſtian is acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Math.</hi> 7.14.</note> That <hi>few are choſen</hi> amongſt many which are <hi>call'd;</hi> that the <hi>Gate which leads to Life is ſtrait &amp; narrow;</hi> &amp; that there are but <hi>few who find it:</hi> ſo that all the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Appearance of God's Mercy, when 'tis well examin'd ſeems to vanish out of ſight, or shrink into a little compaſs, if compar'd with the innumerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of thoſe Reprobates,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22.</note> who are <hi>prepar'd</hi> and <hi>fitted for Deſtruction.</hi> Is not this enough to make a Sinner tremble? A Sinner who is conſcious to himſelf of being much more guilty in the ſight of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:151194:81"/>God, than many millions of thoſe Souls who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gone before him, &amp; already ſuffer the eternall flames of Hell?</p>
               <p>Theſe Thoughts, I muſt confeſſe, are Terrible. To him whoſe eyes are open by God's grace to ſee the malice of his Sins, &amp; ſee Death, Judgment, &amp; Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion attend; Such thoughts as theſe, to ſuch a man, are terrible beyond expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But however, if a man be more afraid than hurt, where is the harm of all his Fear? Are we not All oblig'd to <hi>humble</hi> our proud hearts <hi>under the powerfull hand of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12.</note> and <hi>work out our Salvation with Fear &amp; Trembling?</hi> Is not our obligation to <hi>fear,</hi> conſiſtent with our
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:151194:82"/>greater motives, greater obligations to <hi>hope?</hi> Tis one of the moſt dangerous miſtakes that we are ſubject to. We ſeem to fancy that our <hi>Fear</hi> deſtroys our <hi>Hope;</hi> &amp; that we cannot <hi>hope</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we ceaſe to <hi>fear.</hi> We take theſe two Affections of the Mind for mortall Enemies, becauſe their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are ſo oppoſite. But, as that Friendship is the greateſt, which no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Humour can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide: So, if we examine well the matter, we shall find that <hi>Fear</hi> &amp; <hi>Hope</hi> are ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable Friends, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly ſubſiſt without each other's company; The Separation of the one, is certainly the Death &amp; Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the Other. <hi>Fear,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:151194:82"/>Hope, degenerates into <hi>Deſpair. Hope,</hi> without Fear, is now no longer Hope, but dangerous <hi>Preſumption.</hi> If now &amp; then our Minds are troubled &amp; perplext with Fear; We muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſently conclude, that we have loſt our Hope: No, no; We should have loſt it, if we did not fear.</p>
               <p>If the Conſideration of God's Juſtice make a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner tremble; he may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deſire to be deliver'd from the uneaſyneſs, the pain, &amp; the anxiety, which are the troubleſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of his Fear: But, as for <hi>Fear</hi> it ſelf, 'tis an eſſentiall Duty of a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, which cannot upon any terms admitt a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:151194:83"/>If the unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Deſigns and Secrets of God's Providence are apt to fill our Souls with appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions &amp; fears; this only helps us to perform the one half of our Duty, without prejudicing the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the other: for the more we <hi>fear</hi> his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> ſo much more we <hi>haſten</hi> to the shelter of his <hi>Mercy.</hi>

We have his Word: We have his Oath: He cannot take his own Great Name in vain; And He has ſworn by his own Life, <hi>He has no pleaſure in our Death;</hi> He dos not, of himſelf, deſire it; <hi>but that we return &amp; live.

                  <hi>I came not,</hi> ſays He, <hi>to call the Juſt, but Sinners;</hi> He came, becauſe 'twas neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary he should come: And therefore for their ſakes, for whom it was moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for them he prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally came. He never was ſo kind to any, as to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:151194:85"/>All his Converſation was in their Company, He made it his chief buſineſs to oblige them, He follow'd them from place to place, He thought of nothing elſe but how to gain their love, He came with a deſign to enflame their hearts, He brought down fire from Heaven with him, &amp; wisht for nothing more than that this fire might burn. His more than ordinary Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was in all occaſions ſo viſibly remarkable, that He was taken notice of, &amp; pointed at. The Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees were ſcandaliz'd to to ſee't. And in thoſe days, it was his great Reproach; He was too much <hi>a Friend to Publicans &amp; Sinners.</hi>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:151194:86"/>his Buſineſs upon Earth. His great Compaſſion of their Miſery, was the occaſion of his coming: And ſince their Indigence firſt brought him from abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, it was no wonder the Relieving of it was his chief Employment here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. He came as a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian to his dying Friends, whom He moſt dearly lov'd; &amp; therefore took moſt care, &amp; was the moſt concern'd, for thoſe who were moſt dangerouſly ſick. Thus did our God behave himſelf to Sinners. Thus did he love his Enemies; and treat them as his deareſt Friends. Thus did He <hi>live</hi> to ſerve them, till at length He <hi>died</hi> to ſave them.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34.</note> &amp; at the <hi>right hand</hi> of his Father is our <hi>Advocate</hi> in Heaven, <hi>making interceſsion for us;</hi> ſurely <hi>now</hi> our humble Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, joyn'd with <hi>his,</hi> &amp; offer'd <hi>in his Name,</hi>

               <p>Let us therefore, once for all, humbly confeſs, &amp; own our Fault. The Truth is; We are proud, &amp; willing to excuſe our ſelves. We are willing to lay the

               <p>All we can ſay, in our defence, is that our ſins are <hi>great,</hi> God will not look upon ſuch grievous <hi>Sinners</hi> as we are. I cannot, ſay they are not <hi>great,</hi> or that we are not grievous <hi>Sinners:</hi> But, that <hi>therefore</hi> God will never look upon us, is as <hi>falſe</hi> as the Word of God is <hi>true.</hi> He hates the Sin, but loves the Sinner: He hates
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:151194:88"/>the Leproſie, but loves the Leper:

               <p>Thus the Colour of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty gives a reputation to the Deluſion: We cover the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Cheat with an agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſguiſe: And betwixt gratifying our Inclinations, on the one ſide, with a criminall condeſcendance, &amp; pacifying the remorſes of our Conſcience, on the other ſide, with a plauſible
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:151194:90"/>pretence of future amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at a more convenient time; We make Virtue, in appearance, ſubſcribe to our Vices, &amp; counterfeit God's Hand to one of the worſt Temptations of the Divel.</p>

               <p>Tis true: we cannot but confeſs, (to the great shame of our Ingratitude,) that our Creator loves us far above our merit. If we look back from hence as far as the firſt Creation, &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry our ſerious thoughts through all the ſteps of Providence, we meet with nothing but remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:151194:91"/>of his good wishes towards us. Nay, if we yet look farther back from the firſt moment of this World into Eternity, We find Him, before the beginning of all Time, entertaining his Thoughts with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation of our wellfare; And in the firſt page of his Eternall Accounts, we find the great Deſign of Man's Redemption, that ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Myſtery of Mercy &amp; Juſtice, the Incarnation of our Lord &amp; Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; who held nothing ſo dear, no obligation ſo important, as our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; even to the degree of laying down his Life for the advantage of that ſacred Intereſt. See here, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which we have to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:151194:92"/>think He loves us! Yet give me leave to tell you, He is not ſo fond of us, but that He can be angry at us, when He finds his Love neglected. Witneſs all thoſe miſerable Chriſtian Souls, who <hi>once</hi> were happy in the ſame Teſtimonies of his Affection: Who thought, as we do, to reform their lives at a more convenient ſeaſon: Who ſuppos'd, as we do, that God's <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> Grace would never fail to be at hand, when ever they pleas'd to have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for it. Alas, poor Souls, they now are lodg'd in the flames of Hell for all Eternity; and know, too late, that though God never fails to beſtow his <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> Graces, where He finds
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:151194:92"/>a faithfull correſpondency of our Endeavours with his mercifull Aſſiſtance; yet He often shuts his Hand, if we withdraw ours. He dos not <hi>firſt</hi> deſert us: Yet, if deſerted by us, 'tis no wonder if He treat us upon equall terms, &amp; ſo deſert us.</p>
               <p>Wonder not, that God who is ſo infinitely good, can find in his heart to Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andon thus a Sinner, who ſtifles the remorſes of his Conſcience, who reſiſts the frequent inſpirations which invite him to Repentance, who has always ſomething elſe to do when he thinks of his Duty, always is ſo rude, ſo ſcornfully uncivill, in receiving all the Embaſſys of Peace which Heaven ſends
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:151194:93"/>him; that every trifling Object which ſalutes his Fancy, every miſerable creature which a ſilly Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion recommends to him, is ſure to have the prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, &amp; be the firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>How often dos God court us, when we are alone, as it were carefully managing that favourable occaſion, when it may be preſum'd we are at leiſure for his entertainment? But, alas! we are perhaps never leſs alone, than when we are alone: The Common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Mankind is then moſt buſy to prevent the advantage of ſuch a happy circumſtance. How often dos He apply himſelf to us, when any ſuddain Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:151194:93"/>has croſs'd our incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, when we have been diſſappointed in our intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, when we begin to find our labour loſt in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of what we hunted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when we ſit down an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry &amp; affronted at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of our miſtake, almoſt ready to fall out with the World for having cheated us: then it is that He takes hold of this conjuncture; begins in a loving manner to expoſtulate with us; to exprobrate to us how trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous a Friend we find the World to be; on the contrary, how conſtant &amp; faithfull a Friend He has been to us, from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to this moment; how ready He is, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all that's paſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:151194:94"/>us with open arms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to favour again, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ſincerely to Him. And how do we hearken to all this? Why, truly, it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes away like a little Fit of melancholy; we were <hi>then</hi> in an ill humour; we are <hi>now</hi> glad 'tis over; &amp; ſo we think no more on't. What ever God ſpeaks to our Hearts, is all out of doors: Our Hearts are shut againſt him,

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:151194:96"/>Goodneſs, Longani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, &amp; Patience, not only to the utmoſt degree of contempt, but even to an impudent aſſurance of obtaining Mercy when we pleaſe, although we have ſo <hi>much,</hi> ſo <hi>often,</hi> &amp; ſo <hi>long,</hi> contemn'd it. This is a ſufficient Reaſon, why God may abandon ſuch <hi>proud</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents as often as He plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: and this Reaſon is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a ſort of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation (if a man may term it ſo) incumbent upon Providence, if not always, at leaſt generally &amp; for the moſt part, to treat them according to their merit.</p>
               <p>This Obligation ariſes from two Titles. God is the the <hi>Creator</hi> of Man, &amp; the <hi>Redeemer</hi> of Sinfull man. The
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:151194:97"/>firſt gives Him the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of being the ſupreme and univerſall, Lord and Maſter of the Univerſe; under which Character it belongs to him to give Law to all the parts of it, &amp; take ſuch methods as may with a ſmooth &amp; eaſy, yet ſtrong &amp; ſteddy influence promote &amp; carry on the great Deſign of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Hence comes the Obligation of ſupporting the Credit, &amp; maintaining the Authority of his Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which ſinks im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly &amp; falls to nothing, if his too great Indulgence <hi>always</hi> tolerate the open violation of his precepts, joyn'd with all the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, affronts, and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, of a haughty Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:151194:97"/>that will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd but when he pleaſes, will not take the advantage of thoſe favourable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities which are ſo often offer'd him, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs the <hi>only neceſſary</hi> Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his life from time to time, upon a proud Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of being receiv'd at any hour whenſoêre he pleaſes. Nothing under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven can in this occaſion keep up the Spirit &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of Diſcipline amongſt us, and place the Fear of God before our eyes, but a juſt &amp; ſevere Punishment, ſuch as becomes the Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of an angry God abus'd, affronted, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd; which is, to treat us as we treat Him, leave us as He finds us, &amp; flatly
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:151194:98"/>refuſe us Audience when we make our ſupplications to Him.</p>
               <p>This Motive which ariſes from the Title of <hi>Creator</hi> is aboundantly ſufficient; but yet the Title of <hi>Redeemer</hi> is a far more powerfull induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſame rigour of Juſtice. The Creation of the World was but a ſmall Expence: A Word <hi>ſaid,</hi> &amp; the whole Work <hi>done.</hi> But the Redemption of ſinfull Man, the Extraction of him out of the profound Abyſs of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Malice,</hi> was a more laborious Maſterpiece of Mercy &amp; Juſtice; it coſt him his deſcent from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, a painfull life for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years upon Earth, &amp; the laſt drop of his moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloud upon the Croſs.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:151194:98"/>Having redeem'd us from the Divel, at ſo dear a rate, &amp; having paid the utmoſt price of our Salvation, He has a ſtrict Right to the Honour and Reputation of his Mercy;
<note place="margin">

But if we ſucceed in any thing, that ſeems praiſeworthy, either in the Sight of God or Man, we preſently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the reputation of it to our ſelves.

<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rodr. ch.</hi> 13.</note> is when we <hi>love</hi> to be neglected, and <hi>deſire</hi> to be deſpis'd. As hard as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, if we were once well grounded in the firſt Degree, the way would then be short &amp; eaſy to the ſecond. If we had but once a mean <hi>opinion</hi> of our ſelves; if once we truly <hi>thought</hi> our ſelves contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible; if once our <hi>judgment</hi> were convinc't that we deſerve to be deſpis'd by
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:151194:126"/>All the World; it would not then be difficult to <hi>ſuffer</hi> their contempt: We then should even <hi>wish</hi> for ſuch occaſions of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our humility: they would be always very wellcome to us, &amp; afford us, every day, new joy &amp; conſolation. <hi>Tis certain,</hi> ſays S. Bonaventure, <hi>that we naturally</hi> love <hi>to ſee our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents approv'd, &amp; our opinions followd. VVhich if it be true, as our experience too often teaches us, why are we ſo uneaſy when we ſee our neighbours undervalue us? Tis queſtionleſs, becauſe we are not, in our judgment, thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinc't that we deſerve to be deſpis'd; for if we were, we should be glad to ſee our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours follow our opinion.</hi>

                  <p>The Diſpoſitions which
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:151194:126"/>make way to this Degree, are, 1. to shun as much as may be, all occaſions of praiſe. 2. To ſuffer patiently the humours and inſults of others. 3. To take no pleaſure in our being celebrated and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Avoiding all occaſions of praiſe,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to us by the great example of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, &amp; the univerſall practiſe of the Saints. Our Saviour fled from thoſe who thought to chooſe him King. He shewd his Glory on mount Thabor to no more than three of his Diſciples; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly charg'd them not to ſay a word on't. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever his great Charity
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:151194:127"/>appear'd in doing mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, his great humility appear'd no leſſe in his commanding ſecrecy.

                  <p>Humility affects not to appear in her own likeneſs. She forbears expreſsions which diſcover her. She deſires, not only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal all other Virtues, but particularly, to conceal her ſelf.

                  <p>Tis a dangerous thing to ſpeak of one's ſelf; either well, or ill: if <hi>well,</hi> 'tis to appear <hi>deſerving;</hi> if <hi>ill,</hi> 'tis to appear <hi>humble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An humble man had rather hear another ſay,

                     <hi>that he is miſerable, inconſiderable, good for nothing;</hi> than be heard to ſay it of himſelf. At leaſt, he never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts it. Whoſoever
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:151194:127"/>ſays it, he <hi>beleeves</hi> it firmly and is therefore <hi>glad</hi> that others are of his opinion.</p>

<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rodr. ch.</hi> 14.</note> that the eſteem of men, is <hi>generally,</hi> if not <hi>always,</hi> an Occaſion of Preſumption &amp; Pride; &amp; that the Saints themſelves, who by Gods Grace were more ſecure from danger, always fled from ſuch temptation, even with averſion &amp; horrour: we should certainly conclude, that whatſoever may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the humbling of us, &amp; inducing us to have a mean opinion of our ſelves, should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd with <hi>patience,</hi> &amp; embrac't as uſefull means of purchaſing, preſerving, &amp; encreaſing our Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:151194:128"/>The opportunities of practiſing this Virtue are ſo frequent every day, that if we did but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully forecaſt to profit by them, we might almoſt make it our continuall Exerciſe.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>B. III. ch.</hi> 49.</note> It happens, ſays the Devout Kempis, <hi>that what is pleaſing to others, shall go well forward; that which thou wisheſt, shall not ſpeed: That which others ſay, shall be heard; what thou ſayſt, shall be nothing regarded: Others shall ask, &amp; shall receive; thou shalt ask, &amp; not obtain: others shall be great in the praiſe of men; but of thee there shall be no ſpeech: to others this or that shall be committed; but thou shalt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted fit for nothing. At this, Nature is apt ſometimes to be troubled; and 'tis much, if thou
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:151194:128"/>art humble enough, to bear it</hi> patiently <hi>with ſilence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> To be charm'd ſo little with Eſteem &amp; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as to <hi>take no pleaſure</hi> in them, is a third ſtep to the height of this Degree; much harder than the other two. For as Saint Auſtin very well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, <hi>although it may be eaſy for a man to live without praiſe, when it is denied: tis hard enough for any man, to take no pleaſure in it, when 'tis freely offerd him. A proud man,</hi> ſays S. Gregory, <hi>rejoyces even when he knows that his admirers are miſtaken in him. For he cares not what his Life is in the ſight of God, but only values the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it in the ſight of Men. And therefore he his puft up with the leaſt applauſe: He fancys he
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:151194:129"/>has reap't the fruit of his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: He deſires no more: He aims at nothing elſe.</hi> But, on the contrary, an humble man is ſo averſe from the applauſe of Men: that he's uneaſy with it. He's afraid there is no reall ground for it: or elſe he fears the loſſe of his Reward in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by receiving of it here; &amp; trembles at the apprehenſion of exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for a little popular Eſteem, the Crown of everlaſting Glory, which he hopes for. Salomon ſays,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.21.</note> 
                     <hi>As gold is tried by the furnace, ſo is a man by his praiſe.</hi> S. Gregory adds; <hi>if he grows vain by hearing it, he's like falſe gold, which ſuffers by the fire: but if the hearing of it makes him tremble, leaſt it may
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:151194:129"/>be prejudiciall to his ſoul before the Souvereign Judge; 'tis like a fire which only ſerves to purify, &amp; give him a new luſtre.</hi> We should be ſo grounded in the knowledg of ourſelves, that when we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, we may always have before our eyes our baſe Unworthyneſs; and be ſo much the more asham'd, to think, we are ſo far from being what we <hi>ſeem</hi> to be; that we fall short of being, even what we <hi>should</hi> be.</p>
                  <p>By theſe three Steps we come at laſt to the Degree of <hi>loving</hi> &amp; <hi>deſiring</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued &amp; deſpis'd:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rodr. ch.</hi> 15.</note> We become, not only hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in our <hi>Judgment,</hi> but our <hi>Heart.</hi> The firſt degree, which is Humility of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:151194:130"/>was not to be found in J. C. as S. Bernard well obſerves: becauſe He knew himſelf too well, to have a mean <hi>opinion</hi> of himſelf, or <hi>think</hi> himſelf contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, or <hi>judge</hi> that He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to be deſpis'd by all the World. But the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Degree, the true humility of <hi>Heart,</hi> was the Humility of our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. He <hi>took pleaſure</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending, &amp; becoming Man: He <hi>lov'd</hi> to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, ſcorn'd, &amp; ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul'd: He heartily <hi>deſir'd</hi> to undergo all injuries, inſults &amp; outrages. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Example of our Maſter. See the Leſſon which he came to teach us.

                  <p>A true Diſciple of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> is dead to all things in this world; he hates it, &amp; deteſts it; he deſires not to be valued &amp; eſteem'd in't; but embraces all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations with the ſelf ſame paſſion, which worldly perſons have for Honour &amp; Eſteem; and is as <hi>glad</hi> to meet with all occaſions of appearing inconſiderable &amp; contemptible, as they are <hi>overjoyd</hi> to meet with opportunities of ſeeming Great.</p>
                  <p>To know if we are true Diſciples of our Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rodr. ch.</hi> 16.</note> &amp; have perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd this Virtue; we muſt, <hi>by this Rule,</hi> examine well the diſpoſition of our <hi>Heart,</hi> &amp; ſee if we rejoyce as much at being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:151194:131"/>valued &amp; deſpis'd, as others do at being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd &amp; applauded.</p>
                  <p>This Examen is the Touchſtone of Humility.
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> For 'tis agreed upon by all, that <hi>Virtue</hi> is imperfect in us, till we practiſe it with ſatisfaction &amp; <hi>pleaſure.</hi> If we find the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance in the practiſe, when occaſion ſerves; &amp; uſe much preparation to ſurmount the difficulty of it; 'tis indeed the way to acquire ſuch Virtue, but it alſo is a certain mark, we have not yet acquir'd it in perfection. A Maſter of an Art, as Ariſtotle ſays, has ſuch a habit of it, that he uſes no deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, but performs the operations of it with
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:151194:131"/>ſuch eaſe, he ſcarce knows what he's doing when he dos his work. And Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers tell us, that in ſurpriſing Accidents, we act not by <hi>Reflection,</hi> but by <hi>Habit.</hi> For which reaſon, 'tis in vain to examine, what our Inclinations are (&amp; whether we are <hi>truly Humble,</hi> or no) by what we do with preparation &amp; leiſure: We muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examine, what we ſuddainly are apt to do, without deliberation.</p>
               </q>
               <p>However,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rodr. Chr.</hi> 17.</note> if by this Examen we obſerve, that notwithſtanding our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to improve, we frequently are <hi>importun'd,</hi> &amp; ſometimes <hi>overcome,</hi> by Pride &amp; Vanity: if we are yet ſo far from taking pleaſure in
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:151194:132"/>the practiſe of Humility, that we are hardly able to ſupport in ſilence the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs we ſuffer in it: Let not this diſcourage us: But on the contrary, the more we ſee our weakneſs, let it humble us the more; &amp; let us learn from thence</p>
               <p>
                  <q>to uſe our utmoſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in laying a more firm Foundation of <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Humility, which is <hi>Humility of Heart.</hi> Tis not a thing impoſſible. For, by the grace of God, we may be able, ſays S. Auſtin, not only to imitate the example of the Saints, but alſo of the Souvereign Maſter of the Saints.

               <p>
                  <q>S.
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Gregory anſwers. Tis one thing, to deſire our neighbour's <hi>Eſteem;</hi> another, to rejoyce at his <hi>Profit.</hi> Tis a Crime to covet Reputation for it's own ſake, &amp; rejoyce at being Great in the opinion of men. But yet, to wish as much of it, as may be
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:151194:133"/>neceſſary for ſo good an End, as that of ſerving Souls &amp; gaining them to Chriſt; is an effect of Charity. And thus 'tis lawfull to deſire our neighbour's good opinion &amp; eſteem, <hi>ſo far</hi> as may enable us to do them good: becauſe we <hi>thus</hi> deſire it, only for their ſervice, &amp; the greater glory of our our God, with a ſincere and totall diſengagement from the charmes of Pride &amp; Vanity. If any man, who naturally <hi>hates</hi> a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a Pill, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion procures it, &amp; <hi>deſires</hi> to take it; we may be aſſur'd, that ſuch a man takes phyſick, not Phyſick ſake, but purely for his Health. So when a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:151194:134"/>man, who by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary grace of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, <hi>hates</hi> the applauſe &amp; honour of this World; when ſuch a man procures, <hi>deſires,</hi> &amp; manages with care, the good Opinion of men; becauſe it may be uſefull to him in their ſervice; we may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd he only ſeeks God's Honour, not his own.</q>
               </p>
               <p>However,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> this great Truth is generally much abus'd; &amp; under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of it, we only cover our Ambition, &amp; diſguiſe our Vanity. Wee covet Honours, ſeek Preferments, &amp; intrude our ſelves into Employments, letting ſlip no opportunity of <hi>being</hi> or <hi>appearing.</hi> Great; &amp; all this while, we plead; tis only
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:151194:134"/>
                  <hi>Charity,</hi> to qualifie us for the better ſervice of our Neighbours. <q>We have therefore need of no ſmall circumſpection to diſcern the cheat. The way to know it, ſays S. Gregory, is to examine all <hi>occaſions,</hi> where our Reputation is a thing <hi>indifferent,</hi> &amp; <hi>uſeleſs</hi> to our neighbour. If in theſe, we care not for the good Opinion of men; we may ſuppoſe, that when we are concern'd for't, it is only for our neighbour's ſake, &amp; not our own.</q>

                  <hi>Gregory</hi> thus untys the knot; but S. <hi>Francis</hi> cutts it with more eaſe, &amp; much more clearly takes away the difficulty.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever the <hi>Occaſions</hi>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:151194:135"/>are,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> He roundly anſwers: that our <q>
                     <hi>Charity</hi> begins at home: that if it inclines us to deſire our <hi>Neighbour's</hi> ſpirituall good; with much more reaſon it inclines us to deſire our <hi>Own:</hi> that if our Reputation may be uſefull to our neighbour; our Diſgraces &amp; Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations (incurr'd without our fault) may prove more beneficiall to our ſelves.

                        <hi>Rodr. ch.</hi> 30.</note> &amp; Laſt Degree is the <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Saints,</hi> who are <hi>moſt humble</hi> in the ſight of God, when they are moſt eſteem'd &amp; celebrated by the World.</p>
                  <p>When a Perſon, full of faults &amp; imperfections, has a <hi>mean opinion</hi> of himſelf; <hi>eſteems</hi> himſelf no better than he is; &amp; is <hi>content</hi> to be reputed ſuch as he eſteems himſelf; We may <hi>commend</hi> him, ſays S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard; but have little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:151194:137"/>to <hi>admire</hi> him. Who admires to ſee a poor man have a <hi>mean opinion</hi> of his riches? <hi>think</hi> himſelf no richer than he is? &amp; reſt <hi>content</hi> that others think ſo too? but if a <hi>Rich man</hi> rank himſelf amongſt the <hi>poor,</hi> &amp; treat them with reſpect, as if he were the leaſt conſiderable of them all; This very well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves our admiration.</p>
               </q>
               <p>By this deſcription of the third Degree, we plainly ſee, that the Humility of Saints &amp; the Humility of Sinners is the ſame <hi>in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> though they differ <hi>in Perfection.</hi> Tis true: we wonder not, to ſee a man ſtand <hi>ſteddy</hi> upon even ground. But when we ſee the ſame man ſtand as <hi>firm</hi>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:151194:138"/>upon a lofty pinnacle; we gaze, &amp; wonder at him. All this while, the <hi>Man's</hi> the <hi>ſame;</hi> though we admire him <hi>more,</hi> becauſe the <hi>place</hi> is <hi>higher</hi> &amp; the difficulty <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> So 'tis in our preſent caſe. Humility is either of the <hi>Judgment,</hi> or the <hi>Heart.</hi> The third Degree is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the Firſt, &amp; Second. But however we admire much more an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Saint;</hi> becauſe his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>degree</hi> of Sanctity is <hi>higher,</hi> &amp; the difficulty of his being humble, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>ſeems</hi> much <hi>greater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay <hi>ſeems</hi> greater: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am not apt to think it <hi>is</hi> ſo; upon ſecond thoughts. My reaſon, in short, is This. Humility of <hi>judgment</hi> &amp; of <hi>heart,</hi> are
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:151194:138"/>chiefly grounded in the <hi>Knowledg</hi> of our ſelves, &amp; <hi>Love</hi> of God. The Firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces us to have a mean opinion of our ſelves: the more we <hi>know</hi> our ſelves, the more we think our ſelves contemptible, the more we <hi>judge</hi> that we <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> to be <hi>deſpis'd</hi> by all the World. The Second makes us <hi>glad</hi> to be neglected, &amp; <hi>deſire</hi> to be contemn'd: And as the <hi>Love of God</hi> encreaſes in our hearts; the more we have &amp; ſcorn the tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory honour of this world; the more we <hi>love</hi> to follow the Example of an humble God; the more we hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily <hi>deſire</hi> to be agreable to none but him; as being every day more ſenſible of this great Truth; <hi>He</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:151194:139"/>only <hi>is approv'd;
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.18.</note> whom God commends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us only lay theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions right together. 1. The <hi>Knowledg</hi> of our ſelves &amp; <hi>Love</hi> of God, is that which makes men <hi>Saints.</hi> No Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ever was a Saint <hi>without</hi> them: No man ever was a Sinner <hi>with</hi> them. And the more this Knowledg and this Love encreaſe, the Greater is the Sanctity. 2. This <hi>Knowledg</hi> &amp; this <hi>Love,</hi> is that which makes men <hi>Humble.</hi> Knowledg helps them to be humble in their <hi>Judgments:</hi> Love aſſiſts them to be humble in their <hi>Hearts.</hi> The more they Know &amp; Love, the greater is the <hi>aſsiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> of God's <hi>Grace,</hi> which is the only means of making all things eaſy to us. Why
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:151194:139"/>then may we not conclude? Whoever is a <hi>Saint,</hi> the <hi>greater</hi> Saint he is, the <hi>eaſyer</hi> 'tis for him to be humble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sinners</hi> indeed have much more matter for Humility to work upon. Their Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, their Corruption, &amp; the Miſery of their deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition, are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably worſe. But, which is worſt of all, they are ſo miſerably <hi>blind,</hi> as not to know their miſery. A Beggar, in his drink, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines he's a Prince: &amp; is as proud as if he were. Tis true; he's miſerably poor: but ſince he knows it not; what ſignifies it? He's as proud, as if he were the richeſt man alive. Tis ſo with Sinners. They are drunk with Self-love,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:151194:140"/>Pride, &amp; Vanity. They <hi>little</hi> know, &amp; much <hi>leſs</hi> think, how Poor, how Miſerable, how Contemptible they are. And we may very well apply to them thoſe words of the Apocalypſe: <hi>Becauſe Thou ſayſt,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ch.</hi> 3.17.18.</note> I am rich, &amp; have need of nothing; &amp; knowſt not that thou art wretched, &amp; miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, &amp; poor, &amp; blind, &amp; naked:</hi> Therefore <hi>I counſell thee, to annoint thy eyes, that thou mayſt See.</hi> This is the generall Reaſon why Humility is harder to be found in Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, than in Saints. The Firſt have <hi>more</hi> to humble them: but the more they have, the <hi>blinder</hi> they are, &amp; the leſs they know it. The Second have <hi>leſs</hi> to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them; but the leſs they have, the <hi>more</hi> their eyes
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:151194:140"/>are <hi>open</hi> by God's Grace, &amp; the <hi>more clearly</hi> they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what's enough to make them <hi>fear</hi> &amp; <hi>tremble</hi> all their life.</p>

                     <hi>to whom the winds &amp; &amp; ſea obey,</hi> is pleas'd to make them for a time ſo calm &amp; quiet, that a Man who ſwims upon his plank with induſtry &amp; courage, meets at length, by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, another Veſſel, better than his own; &amp; ſails with much more Comfort, much more Joy, into the Haven, than he would have done if he had never ſufferd Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack in a Storm. S. John Climacus, in his 15. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, inquires <hi>which of the two is Greater in the ſight of God; he who died by ſin, &amp; roſe again to life by Grace? Or
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:151194:148"/>he who never died the ſpirituall death of Sin?</hi> And anſwers, that <hi>whoever Thinks the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent more happy of the two, is much miſtaken.</hi> The Reaſon is: becauſe All Sanctity is founded in <hi>Humility</hi> &amp; <hi>Charity.</hi> Whoever <hi>Loves</hi> God beſt, &amp; is moſt <hi>Humble,</hi> is the Greateſt Saint.

                     <hi>&amp; forgiven moſt.</hi> We read in Scripture ſeverall examples of this nature. <hi>Zachary</hi> as ſoon as he had done ſufficient Pennance for his incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, immediatly had his Speech reſtor'd him; &amp; not only that, but he
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:151194:149"/>was alſo honour'd with the Gift of Prophecying; which we do not read he had before. The <hi>Prodigall</hi> receiv'd much greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and careſſes from his Father, than he ever had experienc't before he left him. <hi>Lazarus</hi> himſelf, (who was the <hi>Figure</hi> of great Sinners) never had the honour to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, at Table, with the Son of God; before he was, by miracle, rais'd from the Grave. S. <hi>Peter</hi> had not confidence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſinn'd, to ask our Saviour, Who he was that would betray him? But, when he had washt away his ſins with Tears, he was permitted to be more familiar with his
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:151194:149"/>Maſter, and was made the Souvereign Paſtor of his Church. From whence tis eaſy to conclude, that Sinners may <hi>ſometimes,</hi> by Pennance, grow more <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> than thoſe Saints who having kept their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, <hi>Love</hi> God leſs fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently, &amp; ſerve him, with more coldneſs &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſays Saint Ambroſe, <hi>the great Goodneſs of our God! How liberall &amp; generous He is, to whom He pleaſes to be mercifull! He's not contented to reſtore what they have loſt.

                     <hi>where Sin abounded, Grace abounds much more:</hi> becauſe, the more
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:151194:150"/>
                     <hi>Sin Humbles</hi> them, the more they are <hi>Exalted.</hi> When a Penitent, whom Sin had blinded, once begins to See, &amp; to diſcover <hi>clearly</hi> the Enormity of his offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he has much more reaſon to be humble all his life, than if he had been always innocent. He looks upon himſelf no better than a Criminall repriev'd, who is upon his good behaviour for his pardon; &amp; perſuades him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he can never give ſufficient proof of his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, &amp; the Sincerity of his Repentance. All his <hi>Exerciſes</hi> of continuall <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> never make him Vain; but only ſerve to humble him the more: becauſe he looks upon them, only
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:151194:150"/>as the Remedies of his Diſeaſes; &amp; ſuch Remedies as he muſt uſe till Death; which is the only End, he hopes to ſee, of his Diſtempers. The Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Thoughts is the Conſideration of his grievous Sins, which he perpetually laments; Where êre he goes, he never leaves the dolefull Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory behind him;

                  <p>If Parables be lawfull, upon ſuch occaſions; I beg the leave, to tell you one. There was a <hi>Generall,</hi> the moſt Endearing, moſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, &amp; moſt Juſt that ever liv'd. He had a Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:151194:159"/>Army under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for ſeverall years: an Army which He gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly rais'd, &amp; paid, Himſelf: an Army which He cherisht, as a Maſter would his Family. He rais'd it meerly for his Country's ſervice; more for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, than his own; and with no worſe Deſign, than to ſecure the Publick Peace from either forreign or domeſtick Enemies. He rais'd Them out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; They ſubſiſted by his Service; Their Eſtates were the Preferments He beſtowd upon them. They were punctually payd; well arm'd; well cloath'd; and No convenience wanting, which a reaſonable Souldier could require. The Camp
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:151194:160"/>was his Delight: His Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Souldiers were his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: Their Exerciſes were the chief Diverſion He took pleaſure in. His Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage He had shewd abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly in former Wars, where He expos'd his Life in their Defence: He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Commanded any thing but what He did Himſelf: They never ſufferd any hardship, which He did not firſt endure: and in the greateſt Dangers, where Death lookt moſt Terrible, He always was the Firſt to meet it, at the head of them, &amp; look it boldly in the Face. If any thing were able to endear a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier's heart, He wanted no accomplishment: He always shewd himſelf as <hi>Brave,</hi> as
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:151194:160"/>He was <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Juſt.</hi> There never was a Man that lov'd his Souldiers more than He: Nor ever was a Generall, in all appearance, more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd. No men could shew more ſigns of being glad to ſerve him with their lives &amp; fortunes. Their Fidelity was written in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads: You might read it in their looks: Their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations shewd it, in his Preſence; Their Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in his Abſence. The Profeſſions, Proteſtations, &amp; ſolemn Oaths, which they ſo frequently repeated, were ſuch evidence, as any man (though not ſo <hi>Good</hi> as He) might venture to rely upon. When firſt the unexpected noiſe of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Enemy began to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:151194:161"/>fill the Land, They ſeem'd as firm as ever. They were All in readyneſs to march at firſt Command. They never shewd more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs, than when they went to meet the Forreign Power which diſturb'd their Peace. Nor is it any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they were ſo cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. They were well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the condition of their Enemies: They knew their weakneſs: in a word, They knew that they were ſure to <hi>Conquer,</hi> if they would but <hi>Fight.</hi> Their Generall, who had ſome ſecret reaſons to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt them, could not ſo diſſemble his concern, but they obſerv'd it. They aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd Him of the contrary. They made Him fresh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:151194:161"/>Proteſtations, &amp; Oaths, that they would faithfully ſtand by Him, to the utmoſt moment of their Lives. He heard: And, even to the laſt, was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to beleeve. But yet the dolefull proſpect, which He had, of ſo inhuman <hi>Treachery,</hi> where He had plac't ſuch Confidence; was an Affliction ſo ſurpriſing &amp; ſo ſenſible; it made Him bleed with grief, to think of it. His Fears immediatly prov'd true. The day of Battell was no ſooner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but they almoſt All deſerted Him, &amp; ſerv'd his Enemy.</p>
                  <p>Sinner, whoêre Thou art, that readſt this Parable, if Thou haſt any ſpark of Honour left, or any thing
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:151194:162"/>of common Juſtice, or Good nature in Thee; I am confident, Thou canſt not but conceive ſome hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of ſo baſe a <hi>Treachery.</hi> However, have a care of being ſo ſevere, as David was, in giving ſentence. Have a care, I ſay, of calling God to witneſs, that <hi>the men who have done this,</hi>

                  <p>If once We Sinners were ſufficiently ſenſible, of what
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:151194:162"/>we are our ſelves, We then should be more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in cenſuring, &amp; railing at, the crimes of Others. If we find our ſelves tranſported with an unbecoming Zeal, which we too often shew too much of; Let us call our Anger home, &amp; find Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for it there. The Caſe is ours. Tis <hi>we</hi> who <hi>are the Men:</hi> Tis <hi>we,</hi> who are the <hi>Traytors:</hi> We our ſelves, who are the <hi>Treacherous</hi> Souldiers, that <hi>deſert</hi> in time of <hi>Battle.</hi> If we offer to compare our <hi>Generall</hi> with theirs; we cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that Ours is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more Endearing, more Deſerving, &amp; more Juſt. When we, in former wars, had been defeated by the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:151194:163"/>common Enemy, &amp; taken priſoners by the Devil; God himſelf deſcended to aſſiſt us, &amp; to rally up our ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd Forces. He immediatly cloath'd us; arm'd us; punctually payd us; taught us all our Exerciſes; train'd us up to all the hardship of a Souldiers life. Whatever He commanded us to <hi>do</hi> or <hi>ſuffer,</hi> He <hi>endur'd</hi> and <hi>did</hi> Himſelf: in every danger He was always at the <hi>head</hi> of us: and every drop of his moſt Sacred bloud, He freely <hi>Sacrific'd</hi> to ſerve us. See the <hi>Standing Army</hi> which our God has mercifully rais'd, to fight for <hi>Heaven</hi> againſt the Powers of <hi>Hell.</hi> The Devil with a <hi>forreign Army</hi> of ſuch <hi>Spirits</hi> as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, endeavours to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:151194:163"/>us. He would never venture to attack us, if he had not ſome <hi>intelligence</hi> amongſt us. All our <hi>Paſsions, Inclinations,</hi> and <hi>Humours</hi> are his Friends. With theſe He always keeps a private cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondance: and by their Aſſiſtance, which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hand aſſure him of, He ventures to invade us, even when our God himſelf is at the head of us. Before the <hi>Day of Battell</hi> comes, we never shrink the leaſt: We march on cheerfully: We know that we are ſure to conquer, if we will but fight. Tis true: Our <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> who ſees the bottom of our Hearts, has reaſon to ſuſpect our Conſtancy. Yet, we aſſure him of the contrary with new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions

                  <p>Tis a shame to ſee, how <hi>eaſily,</hi> how <hi>clearly,</hi> we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Malice &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of Rebellion in our Neighbours: &amp; how <hi>little</hi> we obſerve it in our ſelves.

                  <p>All this while, <hi>we are the Men: we do the Same:</hi> And, which is worſe, we do a great deal <hi>more</hi> in every Mortall Sin.

                  <p>Neither does it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, what commonly is ſaid; that One great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour &amp; his Martyrs was, that by a miracle of Grace He gave them that undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Courage, which by a greater miracle He now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to himſelf. Tis true: He freely ſufferd in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the <hi>Naturall</hi> Fear of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:151194:180"/>Death; to shew himſelf True Man as well as God; to let us ſee at once the Weakneſs of our Nature, &amp; the Power of Grace; and comfort us, by making it appear that ſuch <hi>Infirmities of Nature</hi> are not Sins, as long as <hi>Reaſon</hi> gouverns them, &amp; <hi>Reſignation</hi> ſubmitts to the will of God. But yet there is another greater Difference betwixt his Caſe &amp; theirs. Martyrs, who die for God's ſake, are Secure of their Succeſs; they are ſure not to ſuffer in vain; they are certain to poſſeſs All that they deſire, &amp; to enjoy eternally their God to whom they Sacrifice their Lives. This is the reaſon why our Martyrs look Death boldly in the face;
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:151194:180"/>with open armes receive it; &amp; go to meet it with the ſame aſſurance, as if they went to Heaven. Let the Body ſuffer all the worſt of Pains; the Soul is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd,
<note place="margin">Anima de Deo ſuo ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cura. S. Cypr.</note> the <hi>Soul</hi> is <hi>ſecure of God,</hi> the Soul is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before hand. When Man dies to enjoy God, he is ſure he shall enjoy him. But (alas!) it is not ſo when Jeſus dies for Man. He dies to gain his Love; &amp; at the ſame time knows that he will prove ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. He dies to enjoy him in Heaven; &amp; foreſees he will be damn'd for all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The lively appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of his torments all together was enough to make him <hi>Sorrowfull, even to Death;</hi> but however, if he
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:151194:181"/>have promis'd himſelf the Eternall Salvation of all thoſe dear-bought Souls for which He died, the joyfull aſſurance of ſo happy a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, would have eas'd the burthen of his Grief; His torments, all of them, would have been well come upon that condition. But to ſweat bloud in vain; to be ſcourg'd to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; to ſpend the laſt drop of his ſacred veins to no effect; was an Affliction not to be ſupported, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out praying his Eternall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have pitty &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on Him:

The Tyes of marriage, &amp; Engagements of the world, will never juſtify an idle Life; or any way Diſpenſe with the laborious Task of living like a Chriſtian.

                     <hi>that God expects from wordly Men a Sanctity quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that of Monks. Tis true, indeed, that Thoſe may marry, &amp; Theſe may not: But in all things elſe, the Caſe is equall. They have Both receiv'd the ſame Laws; &amp; Both are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ſame Punishments. VVhen Jeſus laid his Curſe upon the Rich, &amp; thoſe who lead a jolly life in Senſuality &amp; Pleaſure; when He ſpoke of the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Beatitudes; He ſpoke, not only to</hi> Religious, <hi>but to all the Faithfull; and without the leaſt exception. He was never heard to ſay; that the Religious Man shall ſuffer for his Sins, but not the Secular. The difference we fancy in this point, is only an Invention of Men; it is not groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the word of God, who equally obliges All, that will
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:151194:194"/>be ſav'd, to keep his Laws. S. Paul, addreſsing his diſcourſe to married perſons, dos not He require of them as great a share of Sanctity as we can find in the moſt perfect Monks? what Diſengagement he preſcribes to all of us! what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in our Cloaths, our Diet, &amp; our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Riches!</hi>

There is No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo pernicious as this falſe
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:151194:194"/>Opinion. It maintains the greateſt part of Libertins in their diſorders, &amp; encourages imperfect Souls to lead a looſe &amp; lazy Life. Aſſure your ſelves Our God requires, of All, one ſelfsame Sanctity. The</hi> Means, <hi>of our arriving to it, may be</hi> different; <hi>but yet Religious Perſons have no other</hi> Aim <hi>than we have. They deſign</hi> to ſave themſelves, <hi>and ſo do we.

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it follows clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that the Ghoſpel being preach't &amp; made for All, we All are bound to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; we All muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to acquire the Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity demanded by it; we muſt All be thoroughly perſuaded, that it is the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:151194:195"/>only way which leads to Heaven, and that every other way is ſure to end in everlaſting Death. Tis true; the methods &amp; the Exerciſes, which are us'd &amp; follow'd in Religious houſes, to arrive to ſuch Perfection, are quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what is uſually preſcrib'd to Wordly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: But their <hi>Virtues</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways are the <hi>ſame,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their <hi>Exerciſes</hi> are not. Theſe two things we commonly confound; to wit, the <hi>Exerciſes</hi> &amp; the <hi>Virtues</hi> of a Chriſtian. We imagine, for example, that a <hi>modeſt</hi> &amp; a homely <hi>Dreſs</hi> is only fit for Cloiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; where they always wear a certain <hi>Habit,</hi> poor &amp; plain. We fancy that the

                     <hi>Recollection</hi> which is practis'd in Religious Houſes is a thing peculiar to their Character; becauſe we find, that only They have certain Hours allotted them for keeping ſilence. We imagine alſo that a <hi>Penitentiall</hi> life belongs to none but them; becauſe They faſt, &amp; practiſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Auſterities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Superiours. Tis a great miſtake. Theſe <hi>Virtues</hi> all are <hi>Evangelicall:</hi> We find them in the Ghoſpel, which is <hi>ours</hi> as much as <hi>theirs:</hi> They are preſcrib'd to <hi>all Men</hi> by the <hi>Common Rule</hi> of Chriſtianity: And, though we have not (as <hi>Religious</hi> have) ſo great Advantages to make the practiſe of them Uniform

                  <p>All God's <hi>Children</hi> ſay the ſame:
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> they dayly pray to their Eternall <hi>Father,</hi> that his <hi>Kingdom come:</hi> And their <hi>Deſire</hi> of Everlaſting
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:151194:205"/>Life, (though ſometimes out of Mind) is <hi>always</hi> in their Heart. By this, they <hi>Pray</hi> inceſſantly. By this, they are attentive to <hi>God's Preſence,</hi> in the midſt of thoſe Employments &amp; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which otherwiſe would eaſily divert them from the <hi>Thought</hi> of Him. By This, they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Recall</hi> their wandring Thoughts, <hi>Renew</hi> their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying Fervour, <hi>Enflame</hi> their cooling Love, <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage</hi> their deſponding Hearts, &amp; <hi>March</hi> a great deal <hi>faster</hi> towards Heaven. <hi>VVhen the Scripture commands us,</hi> ſays S. Auſtin, <hi>to Pray Always; we are not therefore oblig'd to be always on our knees, or always ſinging Pſalms in Choire: we only are oblig'd to
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:151194:205"/>have continually, in the Bottom of our Heart, a true Deſire to leave this Earth &amp; enter into Heaven. This continuall Deſire muſt ſtill perſever in our Heart. VVe always muſt lament, &amp; ſigh; and ſay; I am a Captive &amp; a Pilgrim; I am far from Home; I am not with my God.</hi> Tis true, (S. Auſtin adds,) a Juſt Man may divert himſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; &amp; ſpend ſome hours, in ſuch Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as appear quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from <hi>Gaining Heaven.</hi> Tis, alas! the Servitude of his Captivity, which thus obliges him to work for the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> whilſt he is a Slave to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> But however, in the midſt of all his <hi>Slavery,</hi> He never can forget the <hi>Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;</hi> He laments, He ſighs,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:151194:206"/>He always wishes to be There: And Thus He <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Prays</hi> to God that He will pleaſe to grant him the Poſſeſſion of that Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Good, which only can Suffice to make Him <hi>truly</hi> &amp; <hi>for ever</hi> Happy.</p>
